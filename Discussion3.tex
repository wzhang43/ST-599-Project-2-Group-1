Task Assigned


\begin{itemize}

/item Nandhita: Getting the sampling query working with the SQL database for at least one year/month/region. (so we can toss other regions/ year/month combos into a for loop)

/item Wanli: To get the regional lists squared away

/item Matt: To get the analysis done on the population data (which can then be applied to sampling data)

Agreed to finish these tasks by class time on Monday.

Looking ahead, we want all the data pulled by Weds next week, so we can easily finalize the report & presentation over the weekend.
