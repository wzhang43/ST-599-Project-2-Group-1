\section{Introduction \& Question of Interest}
The data we used in this project is Airline On Time Statistics from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, available from January 1995 through February 2014. The population used in this project includes data from June 2003 to February 2014 during which weather-related flight delays are noted. Our question of interest is:\\
\textbf{Are there geographical patterns in weather-related flight delays, and do these change over time?}\\
This study aims in answering the question of interest by using
\begin{itemize}
\item Population data
\item Samples by appropriate sampling technique
\end{itemize}
